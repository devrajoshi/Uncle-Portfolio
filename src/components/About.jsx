        <p>
          I am a faculty member at Mahendra Ratna Campus Tahachal, Tribhuvan
          University, Nepal. I completed my Ph.D. in education from Banaras
          Hindu University, India, and my M.Ed. in mathematics education from
          Tribhuvan University. My research interests include educational
          technology, digital pedagogy, applied mathematics, quantitative
          research, item response theory (IRT), structural equation modeling
          (SEM), machine learning, and various issues related to digital
          pedagogy. I have been actively involved in facilitating digital
          pedagogy, mathematics teaching-related software and applications, and
          quantitative data analysis tools such as SPSS and JASP.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also work with structural equation modeling tools like AMOS,
          referencing tools like Mendeley and Zotero, qualitative data analysis
          tools like Atlas.ti, academic/scientific writing, and other
          teaching-learning and research-related software and applications.
          Additionally, I have substantial experience in curriculum development,
          report writing, data analysis, thesis supervision, research project
          development, monitoring and evaluation of research projects, and test
          item writing.
